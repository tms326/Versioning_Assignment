My name is Tim Skinner and all I did over the summer was work 40 hours every week and sleep the rest of the time, sometimes I ate as well.


My name is Michael Himes and this summer I had an internship at Ontario Systems in Muncie. I worked 40 hours per week and didn't get to do much else. However, I think the internship was a good experience for me and I think I gained a lot from it. 


My name is Drew Ellery and this summer I took 5 classes and visited my grandparents, then I applied for classes.
