My name is Michael Himes and this summer I had an internship at Ontario Systems in Muncie. I worked 40 hours per week and didn't get to do much else. However, I think the internship was a good experience for me and I think I gained a lot from it. 


My name is Isaac McKinney and I worked about 30 hours a week this summer, programming microcontrollers at Horizon Automation and Fabrication. I was also able to go explore a cave in Ohio.
